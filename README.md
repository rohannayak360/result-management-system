# 🎓 Student Management System

A desktop-based Student Management System built using **Python** and **Tkinter** that allows users to manage student records efficiently. This project demonstrates the use of GUI development in Python along with basic file/data handling operations.

## 💡 Why I Built This

This project was created to **explore GUI development with Tkinter** and to apply Python in a real-world use case — managing student records. It helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- GUI widgets and layout management
- Event handling
- Data input/output
- Form design and validation
