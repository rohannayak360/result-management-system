## 💡 Why I Built This

After completing my Student Management System project, I wanted to explore how to apply Python and Tkinter for data-based decision-making. This project allowed me to practice:

- GUI development with Tkinter
- Conditional logic (grading system)
- Form validation
- String formatting and user interaction

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- **Tkinter** – for GUI interface
- **Functions** – to handle form logic
- **Entry widgets** – to collect user input
- **Labels/Frames/Buttons** – for interface layout
- **String formatting** – to display results
- (Optional) **File I/O** – to save/export data

## 💻 Running in VS Code

To run this project in Visual Studio Code:

1. Open the project folder in VS Code
2. Make sure `student.py` is selected
3. Click the **Run ▶️** button in the top right corner, or press:
   - `Ctrl + F5` – Run without debugging
   - `F5` – Run with debugging
4. The Tkinter GUI will launch in a separate window

No external dependencies needed — only Python and Tkinter!
